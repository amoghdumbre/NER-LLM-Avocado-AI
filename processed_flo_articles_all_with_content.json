        "content": "You\u2019ve probably heard of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), but how about premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)? Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the condition, from the symptoms to look out for to the treatment options available.\nKey takeaways\nPremenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a more severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS).\nPMDD causes debilitating emotional symptoms that begin before your period and go away shortly after it starts.\nYour health care provider might ask you to track your symptoms for a few months to diagnose you with PMDD.\nThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all treatment for PMDD, but some options include antidepressants, therapy, or hormonal medications.\nPMDD: What is it?\nPremenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a more severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). While both PMDD and PMS can cause physical and emotional symptoms, such as headaches, bloating, and disruption to sleep, PMDD has a bigger impact on someone\u2019s mood. This can understandably get in the way of your daily life, like work, school, or relationships, and lead to extreme anxiety or depression. For this reason, the DSM-5 \u2014 the manual used to categorize and diagnose mental health disorders \u2014 lists PMDD as a \u201cdepressive disorder.\u201d\nThis might sound scary, but rest assured that help and treatment are available. We\u2019ve got more information below.\nWhat causes PMDD? How common is it?\nPMDD affects around 3% to 8% of women. While we don\u2019t know exactly what causes it, experts think PMDD might be related to an increased sensitivity to fluctuating hormones during the menstrual cycle. \nSome research also suggests that there could be a genetic component.\nPMDD symptoms\nSymptoms of PMDD usually show up in the week before your period before going away a few days after it begins. As we\u2019ve seen, the symptoms of PMDD can be so disruptive that they make working, socializing, and having healthy relationships difficult. It\u2019s also important to note that while PMDD is characterized by emotional symptoms, people may also experience some of the physical symptoms of PMS alongside these.\nEmotional symptoms\nSevere emotional symptoms are usually what marks PMDD as being different from PMS. These include at least one of the following:\nTension or anxiety\nA feeling of hopelessness or sadness\nExtreme mood swings\nNoticeable irritability or anger\nPhysical symptoms\nThe physical symptoms of PMDD can sometimes mirror those of PMS and include things like:\nBloating\nCramping\nHeadaches\nBreast tenderness\nThis isn\u2019t an exhaustive list; for more information on the physical symptoms of PMS that could also be present with PMDD, click here.\nDisorders that look like PMDD\nIdentifying PMDD can be tricky, as it shares similar symptoms with other conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and thyroid disorders. So, it\u2019s important to speak with your health care provider for an official diagnosis.PMDD risk factors \nPMDD is still fairly misunderstood and under researched, but some things that have been shown to increase the risk of developing PMDD include:\nHaving experienced traumatic events in the past, as well as preexisting anxiety disorders\nSmoking cigarettes\nHaving a BMI of 27.5 or higher\nThat being said, it\u2019s important to remember that while these factors could be connected to PMDD, researchers are still working to understand this condition better.\nPMDD complications \nDealing with PMDD can be incredibly challenging, and without treatment, it can lead to depression. In some very severe cases, it could also lead to suicidal thoughts.\nWith this in mind, it\u2019s important to reach out to your health care provider for advice, assessment, and treatment if you think you might be living with the condition. And don\u2019t be afraid to ask your loved ones for all the support you need, too. \nThere are also some national helplines you can contact for support, advice, or just a chat. They\u2019re available 24/7, every day of the week. If you\u2019re experiencing suicidal thoughts and you live in the United States, you can text or call the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988. If you live in the United Kingdom, you can call The Samaritans at 116 123. You can also see more options for support here.\nPMDD Diagnosis\nAs with PMS, there\u2019s no single test that providers use to diagnose PMDD. However, don\u2019t let that discourage you from seeking help. If your symptoms are having an impact on your daily life, schedule a visit with your health care provider for help and support.\nPotential criteria for diagnosis\nTo be diagnosed with PMDD, a doctor will be looking for you to fit a number of criteria. \nFirst, you must have experienced five or more of the following symptoms during most menstrual cycles over the course of a year (and the emotional symptoms must have resolved when your period began):\nAnger or irritability\nDepression\nProblems concentrating\nEither needing more sleep or struggling to sleep\nMood swings\nIncreased appetite\nLoss of interest in your usual activities\nA feeling of being overwhelmed \nPhysical symptoms such as bloating, headaches, and breast tenderness\nIn addition, your doctor will be looking for symptoms that disrupt your normal work or social life and are not related to (or enhanced by) any other medical conditions.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that getting a PMDD diagnosis can be time-consuming and frustrating, but one thing that helps is tracking your symptoms. Keeping a detailed record of your symptoms each month can make it easier to advocate for yourself and be diagnosed. You can use an app like Flo to do this.PMDD treatments options and therapies\nThere is no one-size-fits-all treatment for PMDD, so your health care provider might recommend targeting the symptoms that affect you the most. Currently, management for PMDD includes:\nLifestyle changes, such as decreasing the amount of sugar, salt, caffeine, and alcohol in your diet and getting regular exercise\nAntidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or therapy to manage PMDD symptoms like depression, anxiety, and mood swings\nHormonal birth control or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) injections to suppress hormonal fluctuations caused by your cycle\nPain relief medication for physical symptoms like cramps and sore breasts\nCan you prevent PMDD? \nIf you already have anxiety or depression, then treating these conditions could help to prevent the symptoms of PMS from becoming more severe. If you don\u2019t already have these conditions and your PMDD is caused by hormones or genetics, then it might not be possible to prevent it. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to suffer in silence. You can make the condition easier to live with by making some lifestyle tweaks (more on those in a minute) or receiving treatment as described above.\nTips for living with and managing PMDD \nPMDD can be a challenging condition to manage, but there are some things you can try that might help reduce the impact PMDD has on your daily life. As we saw above, your doctor may suggest some lifestyle changes, particularly in the weeks leading up to your period. These changes can include:\nExercising regularly \nEating a balanced diet (with plenty of protein and carbohydrates)\nCutting back on caffeine, alcohol, sugar, and salt \nManaging stress, for example, with meditation or yoga\nMaking these changes isn\u2019t going to cure PMDD, but practicing self-care could make a positive difference and make your symptoms more manageable.\nTaking care of your emotional well-being when dealing with PMDD is equally important. You might find it helpful to reach out to a therapist or an organization that provides peer support and advice tailored to PMDD.\nWhen should you see a doctor?\nIt\u2019s totally normal to experience some emotional and physical discomfort in the days leading up to your period. However, if these symptoms are impacting your work, family, or relationships or if you feel depressed or have suicidal thoughts, you should always reach out to your health care provider.\nWhat can you expect from your appointment?\nIf you\u2019re concerned that you might have PMDD, your health care provider will want to understand your overall health. This might include asking you about your mental and physical health history and doing a pelvic exam to rule out any other medical conditions. \nTo help with the diagnosis, your doctor might also ask you to record your mood and physical symptoms daily for a number of months. \nIt\u2019s completely normal to feel nervous during appointments. If you ever feel uneasy, you have the right to bring along someone you trust to support you and help you speak up for yourself. ",

        "content": "This article was created in response to the ongoing war in Ukraine for people living in a crisis zone. Any information given below is done so with these circumstances in mind. If you'd like to read this piece in Ukrainian then you can do so for free in the Flo app. In humanitarian disasters, women and people who menstruate might not have the necessary items to manage their periods safely. It\u2019s hard to plan ahead if you need to leave your home in a hurry. And you might not be able to carry your usual items. Your period can create extra worry during an already traumatic time. \nHere\u2019s some helpful advice from Dr. Maria Corniero, an OB-GYN (obstetrician and gynecologist) who works with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (aka Doctors Without Borders), a humanitarian medical organization that helps people in conflict zones.DIY menstrual pads: How to make your own pads\nIf you don\u2019t have pads or tampons, it\u2019s actually easier than you might think to make your own reusable pad. \u201cTake advantage of an old clean cotton T-shirt (or any cotton material),\u201d suggests Dr. Corniero. Simply cut out a few strips and layer them in your underwear. \nCotton is the best material for DIY pads because it\u2019s a natural, breathable fabric, she adds. Synthetic fibers, such as polyester and lace, can irritate the delicate skin around your genitals \u2014 and make vaginal infections more likely.\nChange your homemade pad every 4 to 8 hours, depending on the amount of bleeding, Dr. Corniero advises. And before reusing, clean it with water (ideally hot water) and soap. The pad might still look stained afterward, but that\u2019s normal. Just be sure to wash the pad until the water runs clear.\nHydrogen peroxide is also an ideal cleaning solution if you have it. Don\u2019t use harsh chemicals such as chlorine bleach or lye (aka caustic soda), she adds. \nIf you have a sewing kit and an old towel, check out this template from the nonprofit Action Aid for more detailed instructions (with easy-to-follow pictures and a video) for making a reusable pad.DIY menstrual pads: Use a menstrual cup\nIf you don\u2019t want to go down the DIY route, the best alternative for single-use period products is a menstrual cup, says Dr. Corniero. \u201cYou can clean it easily and use it again and again.\u201d\nBut she acknowledges that even if you\u2019re a regular menstrual cup user, you might not have one with you at the moment. \nA menstrual cup can be worn for up to 12 hours at a time. In comparison, pads and tampons must be changed several times a day. \nWhat\u2019s more, menstrual cups collect three times as much fluid as a tampon, meaning they\u2019re less likely to leak than other period products. DIY menstrual pads: DIY period products to avoid\nWomen and people who menstruate who don\u2019t have period products sometimes use tissues or paper towels as DIY pads.\nEven in an emergency situation, these replacements are a bad idea \u2014 and not just because they\u2019re uncomfortable. Such methods might put you at a heightened risk of vaginal infections, such as bacterial vaginosis, and vulvar contact dermatitis (aka itching and rashes of the vulva). \nAvoid DIY tampons too, says Dr. Corniero. Items that aren\u2019t designed to be safely used in your vagina might increase the risk of infection.If you are using regular disposable tampons, remember to change them frequently. \u201cIn times of crisis, I could imagine that you\u2019d forget about it for days, which can be very dangerous,\u201d says Dr. Corniero.\nYou should change your tampon every 4 to 8 hours. Going too long between changing one can increase the risk of vaginal infections. This includes a rare but life-threatening condition called toxic shock syndrome where bacteria gets into the body and releases harmful toxins. DIY menstrual pads: How to manage period pain without medicine\nPads might not be the only thing on your mind when managing your period during turbulent times. What if you experience painful cramps?\nDuring a crisis, accessing medicine \u2014 even simple painkillers  \u2014 can be a challenge. \nTo handle cramps without medication, \u201capply heat to the affected area,\u201d says Dr. Corniero. A hot water bottle or heat pad is ideal if you\u2019re able to find one.Self-massage for cramps \nYou could also lightly massage your lower abdomen using circular motions. Try the following steps:\nLie on your back.\nRub your hands together to warm them.\nOverlap your hands on the lower part of your belly.\nUse your palms to massage the entire stomach area in a clockwise direction.\nContinue the same movement on the left side of your stomach, in one-inch intervals, moving downward. Do the same on the right side of your belly.\nUse your fingers to press your navel firmly.\nCirculating outward from your navel, continue in a clockwise, circular motion.\nIf you have trigger points that need extra attention, go ahead and focus on them.DIY menstrual pads: Keeping clean on your period\nIf you\u2019re away from home without access to your usual toiletries, you might also worry about staying clean. How do you keep your genitals hygienic, especially when you\u2019re on your period?\nDr. Corniero assures that all you need is clean water to clean your vulva (the outside of your genitals). \n\u201cUse only water for hygiene,\u201d says Dr. Corniero. \u201cIt is not necessary to use special soaps.\u201d\nYour vagina (the inside part) is self-cleaning, so you don\u2019t need to include it in your bathing routine.DIY menstrual pads: Stress and period\nFinally, it\u2019s worth knowing that it is not uncommon for an acutely stressful situation like this to impact your period. So don\u2019t be alarmed if you notice a change, such as longer or shorter cycles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very normal to miss a period in times of stress,\u201d says Dr. Corniero. \u201cThis is temporary most of the time, and normal bleeding should resume when you go back to a normal routine.\u201d",

If you'd like to read this piece in Ukrainian then you can do so for free in the Flo app.\nMost people know that stress can have a powerful impact on their mental health. But did you know it can also have a significant effect on your physical health too? Yeah, it really does. And this includes our menstrual cycles, too.\nYou may notice stress changes your period. Maybe it comes early, doesn\u2019t show up at all, or your cramps are more painful.\nWe spoke to OB-GYN (obstetrician and gynecologist) Dr. Barbara Levy to learn why and how stress can alter your cycle. She also explains when your cycle might return to normal and how to minimize stress.Stress and period: How can stress mess with your period?\nHere are some of the changes you might notice:\nA delayed period\nAn early period\nA missed period\nA more painful period\nWorse PMS (premenstrual syndrome)Stress and period: Why does this happen?\nThese changes could be caused by emotional or physical stress (or both). It could be because you haven\u2019t slept or eaten enough or because you\u2019re physically exhausted, worried, or overwhelmed. And it\u2019s these stressors that can affect your brain chemistry. \nWhen you\u2019re stressed, your body releases a hormone called cortisol. High levels of cortisol make the hypothalamus (the part of your brain that controls your menstrual cycle) stop ovulation in its tracks. As ovulation is key to having a period, this can affect when \u2014 and if \u2014 your period starts.\nWe don\u2019t know why, but everyone reacts differently to stress. Some people will notice these changes immediately. For others, they may take longer to kick in. And some people might never notice a physical response to stress at all.\nAnd as some people are more sensitive to stress than others, it\u2019s impossible to predict which kinds of stress (short term, long term, mild, moderate, severe) will lead to a change in your cycle. However, we do know that people with anxiety and depression are more likely to be stressed.Stress and period: When will your cycle return to normal?\nThese changes shouldn\u2019t be long term. \u201cTypically, once we stop producing large amounts of the stress hormones, the changes will resolve,\u201d Dr. Levy explains. \nShe adds that most people\u2019s periods will return to normal within one cycle after the stressors are gone.Stress and period: What can you do if stress is impacting your cycle?\n\u201cMy advice is to learn techniques for managing our response to stress, rather than trying to eliminate those things that stress us,\u201d Dr. Levy says. \u201cSome people can\u2019t escape their stress. We can manage ourselves far better than controlling our environment or other people.\u201d\nThese techniques can help limit your body\u2019s release of stress hormones:\nBreathing exercises. You can try this simple calming breathing technique that can be done standing, sitting, or lying down. Whichever position you\u2019re in, place your feet hip-width apart. Breathe in gently through your nose, letting your breath flow into your stomach as deep as is comfortable. You may find it helpful to count from one to five as you breathe in. (If you can\u2019t reach five at first, that\u2019s OK!) Breathe out gently and count to five again. Repeat this for three to five minutes. \nMindfulness meditation. This technique is all about tuning in to \u2014 and being aware of \u2014 the present moment. And you can practice it anywhere, whether you\u2019re sitting still or on the move. Wherever you are, try being quiet while paying attention to how your body feels as you breathe in and out, the sounds around you, and what you can smell or taste. If your mind wanders or gets lost in thought, gently bring your attention back to the present. It can be helpful to do this exercise at the same time every day. \nYou could also try:\nStretching\nConnecting with others and talking about how you\u2019re feeling\nTaking breaks from news stories\nSticking to a sleep schedule, where you go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, as much as possible under the circumstances\nMoving more and sitting less, even if you are in a limited area\nAvoiding smoking\nLimiting how much alcohol you drink\nAvoiding using drugs/substances in ways other than prescribed When and if possible, contact a health care professional if the changes last for more than one cycle. \n\u201cYou may think stress is causing the change, but other medical conditions should be ruled out,\u201d Dr. Levy says. Besides your periods, long-term stress can lead to other serious health conditions, including high blood pressure, prediabetes, and obesity, if left untreated. \nLess frequently, it\u2019s possible to develop a condition called post-traumatic stress. This can mimic similar episodes in the future and may require specialized medical assistance.Stress and period: The takeaway\nRemember \u201cstress is a part of being alive, and our bodies are well protected from most of the short-term impacts of stress \u2014 including weird periods,\u201d Dr. Levy adds. \n\u201cThat said, anyone who feels overwhelmed, out of control, or unable to function should seek medical help [when and] if they are able to.\u201d",

        "content": "As the name suggests, cervical cancer occurs when cancerous cells grow in the cervix. It\u2019s the fourth most common type of cancer in women, and it\u2019s classified in four different stages depending on how much it\u2019s spread to other parts of the body.\nYou might have heard of your cervix but not be totally sure where it is. It\u2019s the small, round, firm passageway that connects the bottom of your uterus to your vagina. Over the last couple of decades, medical professionals have worked tirelessly to raise awareness of the preventative measures you can take against cervical cancer. \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that more than nine of every ten cases of cervical cancer are caused by human papillomavirus infection (HPV), so attending your pap smear and having the HPV vaccine could be life-saving.  \n\u201cCervical cancer, while we have certainly come a long way in reducing incidence and mortality over the past few decades, still requires our full attention,\u201d says Dr. Angela Jones, board-certified obstetrics and gynecology expert.\n\u201cIn accordance with the American Cancer Society, approximately 14,100 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed, and roughly 4,280 women will die from cervical cancer in the United States in 2022.\u201d \nBelow, Dr. Jones explains how the different stages of cervical cancer are classified, plus when and how to book regular pap smears.What are the four stages of cervical cancer?\nAny cancer diagnosis is difficult to deal with. You might feel scared, alone, or unsure about who you can speak to. That\u2019s OK. Know that there are lots of places you can go for support.\nLearning more about the type of cancer you have been diagnosed with can help you feel more in control of your treatment options and may help you to recognize any symptoms. So let\u2019s start by finding out the facts about cervical cancer.  Cancer is named after the place in the body where it started. So, even if it spreads, cervical cancer describes cancer that begins in the cervix. It\u2019s one of five gynecological cancers. \nThere are four main stages of cervical cancer. Stage one is the least severe, and four indicates that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body like the bones, lungs, and kidneys. This stage is also described as metastatic cancer.   \nWrapping your head around each of the cervical cancer stages can be confusing. However, your health care provider will be able to explain all the characteristics of each stage, including the size and depth of the cancer and if it\u2019s spread to any of your other reproductive organs or anywhere else in your body. \nEach stage is categorized by some key features:Stage 4: In stage 4, cervical cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the bladder, bones, liver, or lungs. This is the most advanced stage of cervical cancer.What are the symptoms of cervical cancer in the early stages?\nCervical cancer symptoms may be different for each person and often depend on how far the cancer has progressed. \u201cEarly-stage cervical cancer may have few to no symptoms, which is why screening is so important,\u201d says Dr. Jones. To learn more about what exactly happens at your pap smear appointment, then keep reading. \nDr. Jones explains that advanced cervical cancer symptoms may include:\nBleeding after sex\nUnusually long and heavy periods \nBleeding between periods\nBleeding that occurs after menopause\nWatery, bloody vaginal discharge\nVaginal discharge with an odor\nPelvic pain\nPain during sex\nIt\u2019s really important to note that if you experience any of these symptoms, you shouldn\u2019t automatically assume that you have cervical cancer. You may experience these symptoms for a multitude of reasons, so try not to worry if you notice a change. What\u2019s important is to speak to your health care provider as soon as possible. How is cervical cancer diagnosed?\nTo get to the bottom of the symptoms you might be experiencing, your medical professional may ask you about your medical history and run a series of tests. \nTo assess any pains or abnormal bleeding, they may do an internal examination using a speculum. They will first examine your vulva. Then, using the speculum, they will look at your cervix. If at any point before or during your examination you feel any pain or are uncomfortable, you are well within your right to ask your health care provider to stop or to explain what they\u2019re doing and why.They might also conduct a pap smear at the same time. Using a swab, they will take a sample of cells from your cervix to test for any abnormal changes. The pap smear can be used to test for human papillomavirus (HPV).\nIf they notice any abnormalities, then they may recommend that you have a colposcopy.\nA colposcope is an instrument that has magnifying lenses and allows them to see the cervix in detail. A special solution is usually applied to the cervix to show abnormal areas. During the procedure, it is possible to take a piece of cervical tissue for examination \u2014 a biopsy. This means you\u2019ll have a small amount of tissue removed from your cervix to be examined under a microscope.How is cervical cancer treated?\nTreating cervical cancer isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all approach. Treatment options vary depending on the stage of cervical cancer, as well as other factors like age, overall health, and your personal preferences. \nWhile your health care provider will take all these things into consideration before presenting you with treatment options, you should also be given the opportunity to ask questions about how treatment could impact your sex life, your ability to have children, and if it will trigger early menopause. \nThe most common treatment options include:\nSurgery: Surgery is often used to remove cervical cancer. If the cancer is very small, then you may opt to have part of your cervix removed. If it\u2019s larger, then you may have the cervix and part of the vagina removed. And if the cancer has spread further, then you may have your cervix and uterus removed. This is known as a hysterectomy and means you will no longer be able to carry a pregnancy. Surgery is more common during the early stages of cancer (before it has spread outside of the pelvis). \nRadiation therapy: Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells. It\u2019s often used in combination with surgery to prevent the cancer from coming back. \nChemotherapy: Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. It may be given alone or in combination with radiation therapy and is common for all stages when the cancerous cells have spread outside the uterus. Chemotherapy may also be used before surgery to shrink the cancer. Common chemotherapy drugs include cisplatin, carboplatin, or a combination of cisplatin and fluorouracil.\nTargeted therapy: Targeted therapy is a newer type of cancer treatment that uses drugs or other substances to target and kill cancer cells. It works by interfering with the way cancer cells grow and divide. Common targeted therapies for cervical cancer include bevacizumab (Avastin) and tisotumab vedotin-tftv (Tivdak).\nImmunotherapy: Immunotherapy is a type of targeted therapy that uses the body's immune system to fight cancer. It works by helping the body's immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) is an example of an immunotherapy drug used to treat cervical cancer.How can cervical cancer be prevented?\nThey say prevention is better than a cure, and luckily, cervical cancer screenings can detect precancerous cells early \u2014 when they\u2019re most treatable. Dr. Jones recommends following the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) cervical cancer screening guidelines:The regularity and timing of your pap test can vary depending on where you live. In the US, you will be invited for your first pap smear after you turn 21. In the UK, you\u2019ll have your first screening around the age of 25. If you\u2019ve had an abnormal pap smear in the past, you may be invited to have screenings more frequently, and you can begin to have annual wellness visits with your gynecologist once you\u2019re 18. They will be able to advise you on when to come in for your first pap smear and what will happen.\nScreenings are important, but they\u2019re not the only way to prevent cervical cancer. \u201cLifestyle modifications such as not smoking and practicing safe sex are also helpful in reducing risks,\u201d explains Dr. Jones, who adds that the HPV vaccine can also help prevent cervical cancer.Cervical cancer vaccine: How does it work?\nThe cervical cancer vaccine works by protecting against HPV (the virus that can cause cervical cancer). It does this by stimulating the body to produce antibodies against the virus. \nAccording to the National Cancer Institute, the HPV vaccine is most effective if you have it before you have sex for the first time. This is because HPV is usually spread through sexual contact. However, the HPV vaccine is still effective if you\u2019re already sexually active. It\u2019s given as a series of two to three shots, depending on age. The shots are usually given at least six months apart.\nThe HPV vaccine is available at most health care provider offices, as well as community health centers, pharmacies, and some schools. Speak to your health care provider for more information on where you can get vaccinated. Cervical cancer: The takeaway\nAs with any type of cancer, prevention and early detection make a world of difference. But it\u2019s also important to remember that cervical cancer is treatable \u2014 and there are many treatment options available.\n \u201cRegardless of which option you choose, ensuring that you are getting some sort of screening is key,\u201d Dr. Jones says. \u201cIn all my years of practice, one of the key things that most of the women I\u2019ve ever diagnosed with cervical cancer had in common was they hadn\u2019t had a pap smear in years.\u201d",
